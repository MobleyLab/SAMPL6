# 
# PREDICTION SECTION 
# 
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted. 
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty.  
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows: 
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty 
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

# The 'Name:' keyword is required as shown here. 
Name: 
SlogP (MOE)
 
# SOFTWARE SECTION

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION 
# 
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as: 
# `Physical`, `Empirical`, `Mixed`, or `Other`. 
# Pick only one category label. 
# The `Category:` keyword is required. 
Category: 
Empirical

 
# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION 
# 
# Methodology and computational details. 
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication. 
# Please include the values of key parameters with units. Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated. 
# Use as many lines of text as you need. 
# All text following the 'Method:' keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description. 
Method: 
The logP values were calculated with moe2019.01.01 from Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada (https://www.chemcomp.com)
The method is a re-implementation of the method described in 
Wildman, S.A., Crippen, G.M.; Prediction of Physiochemical Parameters by Atomic Contributions; J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 39 (1999) 868â€“873.
The training set for SlogP was ~7000 structures.
As the method does not return a SEM or model uncertainty, both values are set to zero.

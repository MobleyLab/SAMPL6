# 
# PREDICTION SECTION 
# 
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted. 
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty.  
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows: 
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty 
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

# NAME SECTION 
# 
# Please provide an informal but informative name of the method used.  
# The 'Name:' keyword is required as shown here. 
Name: 
logP(o/w) (MOE)
 
# SOFTWARE SECTION 
# 
# List all major software packages used and their versions. 
# Create a new line for each software. 
# The 'Software:' keyword is required. 
Software:

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION 
# 
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as: 
# `Physical`, `Empirical`, `Mixed`, or `Other`. 
# Pick only one category label. 
# The `Category:` keyword is required. 
Category: 
Empirical

 
# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION 
# 
# Methodology and computational details. 
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication. 
# Please include the values of key parameters with units. Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated. 
# Use as many lines of text as you need. 
# All text following the 'Method:' keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description. 
Method: 
The logP values were calculated with moe2019.01.01 from Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada (https://www.chemcomp.com)
logP(o/w) calculated from a ~100 parameter linear atom type model with r2 = 0.931, RMSE=0.393 on 1,827 molecules.

Name:
YANK-SMIRNOFF-TIP3P-FB-wet-oct

Software:
yank=0.24.0=py36_0

Category:
Physical

Method:
SolvationToolkit was used to generate initial files (AMBER files, mol2 and PDB files), this was done in triplicate.
Parameterized structures were split into different components and the solute/octanol was parameterized with SMIRNOFF and the water was parameterized with the TIP3P force balance water model, remerged and then saved as an Openmm system.
The systems and PDBS were used as input files for YANK, which was used to obtain transfer free energies.

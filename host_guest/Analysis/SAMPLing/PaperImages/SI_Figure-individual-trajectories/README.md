# Free energy trajectories and uncertainty estimates of the individual replicate calculations.

Binding free energy trajectories (top row) and their uncertainty estimates (bottom row) as as a function of the number of
force/energy evaluations. The estimates for the individual replicate calculations were submitted by the challenge participants,
and they are plotted in pastel colors. The best available estimates (in black) for DG and std(DG) were taken to be respectively
the mean and standard deviation of 5 individual DG trajectories. A 95% chi-based confidence interval is plotted as a gray
shaded area around the best estimate of the standard deviation.

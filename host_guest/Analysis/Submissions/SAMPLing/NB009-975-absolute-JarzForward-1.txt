# SAMPLing challenge results for absolute free energy calculations
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following five sections: predictions, computational cost,
# software listing, technical details, and method description. These elements must be provided in the order shown.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be a comma-separated list of exactly 201 fields, 100 of which are optional.
# Each line must be structured as follows: system ID, F(1%), dF(1%), F(2%), dF(2%), ..., F(100%), dF(100%), where
# F(X%) and dF(X%) are respectively the free energy estimate and free energy uncertainty, both in kcal/mol, after X% of
# the calculation. The free energy uncertainties are optional (see example below).
#
# The "Prediction" section should have at least 15 lines: 5 replicates starting from the provided initial configurations
# for each of the 3 host-guest systems in the challenge (i.e., CB8-G3, OA-G3, and OA-G6). Data submission for further replicates
# or different systems is welcomed, although not required.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method:
The estimates were obtained with alchemical non-equilibrium free energy calculations.
Both legs of the thermodynamic cycle were carried out in the same box: i.e. one guest
molecule was decoupled from the solvent while another one was coupled while in the
host binding pocket. The two guest molecules were placed 2.5 nm apart and restrained
with a single position restraint on one of their heavy atoms.

For the guest molecule bound to the host, a set of restraints as described by
Boresch (1 distance, 2 angles, 3 dihedrals) was applied. A force constants of
10 kcal/(mol*A^2) was applied to the distance, and constants of 10 kcal/(mol*rad^2)
were applied to the angles.

Only one end-state (A: bound guest coupled and unrestrained, unbound guest decoupled) was
simulated using 10 simulations of 20 ns each (20.2 ns for CB8), for a total of 200 ns of
equilibrium sampling (202 ns for CB8). Each of these 10 simulation boxes had been previously
built by randomly placing ions in the box at a concentration of 0.1 M, followed
by minimisation with 10000 steps of steepest descent.

For the OA systems, 50 frames were extracted from each of the equilibrium simulations
at an interval of 400 ps. Thus, in total 500 frames were extracted from the equilibrium
simulations. For the CB8 systems, 100 frames were
extracted from each of the equilibrium simulations every 200 ps, for a total of 1000 frames.
The extracted snapshots were used to spawn rapid non-equilibrium alchemical
transitions from the end-state A to B (A: bound guest coupled and unrestrained, unbound guest decoupled;
B: bound guest decoupled and restrained, unbound guest coupled). In the non-equilibrium trajectories, the Hamiltonian
between the two end states was constructed by linear interpolation.

The alchemical transitions were performed in the forward direction (A->B) in 500 ps per simulation
for the OA systems, and in 2000 ps for the CB8 systems. For the unbound guest, charges were annhilated
and van der Waals interactions were decoupled at the same time,
using a soft-core potential for both. For the bound guest, also the Boresch restraints
were switched on/off during the non-equilibrium trajectories by linearly scaling the force
constants. All simulations used Langevin dynamics with a 2fs time step.

The non-equilibrium work performed in each non-equilibrium trajectory was calculated
by means of thermodynamic integration (TI), and dG estimate was obtained using
Jarzynski's Equality after pooling all available work
values available (500).
The uncertainties were estimated by considering the 10 equilibrium simulations and
associated non-equilibrium trajectories separately, thus calculating the standard
error of the 10 separate estimates.

Name:
YANK-GAFF-OPC-wet-oct

Software:
yank=0.24.0=py36_0

Category:
Physical

Method:
SolvationToolkit was used to generate initial files (AMBER files, mol2 and PDB files), this was done in triplicate.
AMBER files were used to create an OpenMM system parameterized with GAFF and the TIP3P water model.
These systems were carefully equilibrated as follows- minimization (1fs), 100ps NVT (2fs), 100ps NPT followed by 100ns NPT (2fs).
The equilibrated systems were loaded into a parmed structure and split into separate components.
The solute and octanol remained parameterized with GAFF, while the water was parameterized with the OPC (optimal point charge) water model.
Structures were remerged and saved as Openmm systems.
The systems and PDBS were used as input files for YANK, which was used to obtain transfer free energies.

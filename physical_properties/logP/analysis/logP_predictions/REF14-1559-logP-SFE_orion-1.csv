# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty.
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.
Predictions:
SM02,7.57,0.25,1.6
SM04,6.2,0.36,1.6
SM07,4.25,0.2,1.6
SM08,2.8,0.23,1.6
SM09,3.13,0.4,1.6

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as:
# `Physical`, `Empirical`, `Mixed`, or `Other`.
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:
Physical


# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details.
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication.
# Please include the values of key parameters with units. Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated.
# Use as many lines of text as you need.
# All text following the 'Method:' keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description.
Method:
Orion set.
